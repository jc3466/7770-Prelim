# 7770-Prelim
This repository includes my solutions to Prelim 1. All answers, plots, and tables are presented and explained in Prelim.pdf. 
So, please consult Prelim.pdf first because it summarizes all of my results, figures, and tables in one document. 


Problem 1 was done using excel: 
* All parameters used for the model are summarized in tables in Prelim.pdf.

* My handwritten solutions for problem 1 are also in Prelim.pdf

Problem 2 used Matlab:

* All codes included in this repository.

* Fsolve was used to solve for the steady state values and Ode45 was used to solve sytems of ordinary differential equations

* All Matlab codes are named by the part of the problem they were used for 

* There should be a 'function' file and a 'solve' script for each part of the problem. The function for that part is called by its 
associated 'solve' script
* For part e, codes for part d was used to solve ODES and plot Z vs. time 
* To generate the plots for parts c through e, execute the Matlab scripts with 'solve' in the name.
