# 7770-Prelim
This repository includes my solutions to Prelim 1. All answers, plots, and tables are presented and explained in Prelim_1.pdf and Prelim_2.pdf

So, please consult Prelim_1 and Prelim_2 pdfs first because they summarize all of my results, figures, and tables. 
My pdf was too large so I had to separate it into two files. To be clear, Prelim_1.pdf does NOT only contain my problem 1 solution. Rather, the 1 and 2 represent the order in which to read the pdfs. 


Problem 1 was done using excel: 
* All parameters used for the model are summarized in tables in Prelim_1.pdf

* My handwritten solutions for problem 1 are also in Prelim_1.pdf 
* Parameters were estimated using bionumbers and the McClure paper. All sources are included in a table with the values and units. 

Problem 2 used Matlab:

* All codes included in this repository.

* Fsolve was used to solve for the steady state values and Ode45 was used to solve sytems of ordinary differential equations

* All Matlab codes are named by the part of the problem they were used for 

* There should be a 'function' file and a 'solve' script for each part of the problem. The function for that part is called by its 
associated 'solve' script
* For part e, codes for part d was used to solve ODES and plot Z vs. time 
* To generate the plots for parts c through e, execute the Matlab scripts with 'solve' in the name.
